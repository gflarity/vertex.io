Making Mobile Development Easy

The Team
- Good Fortune
- this weekend we focused our attention on the problems facing mobile developers

The problem 
    - too many devices too many platforms
    - Java/Python/.NET => Yet Another Language you need expertise in?
    - Customers want your application synchronize with the cloud 
        to work on the subway and then sync when you get out. 

    * These are the problems we want to solve for you. *

Solution
    
    - At Vertex.IO we implement the backend for you.
    - we scale the backend transparently.
    - you pay only for what you use
    - At Vertex.IO We take care of the REST.

What about the Competition

- Amazon WS, Windows Azure, Heroku.
    - The backend design is still your problem.  
    - you need to decide ahead of time 
    - They're not going to help you with offline synchronization. 
        But we will.

How do we do this?
